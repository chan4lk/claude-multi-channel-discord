# Mission Control Dashboard — Backlog

Standalone, independently-shippable proposals for the Mission Control UI at `apps/mission-control/`.

---

## P1 — Fleet Health Bar

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

The current dashboard header shows instance count and uptime but has no per-state breakdown of the Claude fleet. Operators cannot immediately see how many channels are idle, actively working, or stalled without drilling into the Instance Grid.

### Proposed Solution

Extend the fixed HUD header with project-state counters sourced from the MCD server. Add a `/api/fleet` endpoint in the mission control app that reads `channels.json` and cross-references each project's transcript recency to classify state as `idle | active | stalled | autonomous`. Display four neon badges in the header: Idle (cyan), Active (green), Stalled (red pulsing), Autonomous (purple). Clicking any badge filters the Instance Grid to matching projects.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Idle / Active / Stalled / Autonomous counts shown in header; update every 30s
- AC2: Stalled count badge pulses when > 0
- AC3: Clicking a state badge adds a filter query param; Instance Grid reacts
- AC4: Fleet endpoint reads `channels.json` from `MCD_CHANNELS_DIR`; no server restart needed on project changes
- AC5: Header remains one line on ≥ 1280px viewport

## P2 — Project Graph View

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

The Instance Grid shows projects as a flat list with no visual indication of relationships. Operators cannot see coordination links (which channels have been injected into) or cluster projects by state at a glance.

### Proposed Solution

Add a `/graph` page with a force-directed D3 node graph. Each project is a neon node; color encodes state (cyan=idle, amber=active, red=stalled, purple=autonomous); size encodes recent message volume. Edges connect projects that have sent inject events to each other. Node hover shows slug, model, last-active, CLAUDE.md excerpt. Graph layout persists to localStorage.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: All projects in `channels.json` appear as nodes within 1s of page load
- AC2: Node state colors update on ≤ 5s poll
- AC3: Stalled nodes pulse via CSS animation
- AC4: Clicking a node opens a detail drawer: slug, config, transcript snippet
- AC5: Inject edges rendered as directed arrows; absent when no injects recorded
- AC6: Empty graph (no projects) shows placeholder, no crash

---

## P3 — Stall Alert Panel

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

Stalled channels are currently invisible in the dashboard. Operators discover stalls only via the heartbeat bot message or by manually checking each channel. There is no at-a-glance triage surface.

### Proposed Solution

Add a `StallAlertPanel` component shown as a collapsible panel (or dedicated tab) in the dashboard. A `/api/stalls` endpoint classifies each project's transcript using the existing `classifyChannel` logic from `src/heartbeat.ts`. The panel shows: slug, stall reason, stall age, last transcript snippet. Each row has an "Inject" button opening a pre-filled dialog.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Panel auto-refreshes every 30s; badge count shown in Fleet Health Bar
- AC2: Stall reason and snippet sourced from `classifyChannel`
- AC3: Inject dialog pre-populates a suggested continuation prompt by stall type; operator can edit
- AC4: After inject, row removed optimistically; reappears on next refresh if still stalled
- AC5: Empty state ("No stalled channels ✓") shown with green glow
- AC6: Rows older than project's `stuckThresholdMinutes` highlighted red

---

## P4 — Live Activity Feed (enhancement)

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

The existing EventFeed shows raw MCD events but filters nothing: it renders every event type with no visual hierarchy. High-signal events (commits, PRs, injects, stalls) are buried under routine heartbeats and MCP calls. There is no way to pause or filter.

### Proposed Solution

Enhance the existing `EventFeed` component with: (1) event-type filter chips (commit / PR / inject / stall / tool / all); (2) pause-on-hover; (3) color-coded event rows by category; (4) linkable events that highlight the source project node in the Graph View.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Filter chips visible above feed; default = all; state persists in localStorage
- AC2: Pause-on-hover freezes scroll; resume on mouse-leave; "PAUSED" badge shown
- AC3: Commit and PR events rendered with repo icon and truncated commit message
- AC4: Stall events rendered in red; inject events in purple
- AC5: Clicking an event highlights the corresponding project in Instance Grid (query param)
- AC6: Max 500 events retained in DOM; older events pruned

---

## P5 — Proposal / Backlog Overlay

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

There is no way to see each project's pending workload (specclaw proposals, BACKLOG.md items) alongside its runtime status. Operators cannot prioritise which channel needs attention based on queue depth.

### Proposed Solution

Add a "Backlog" toggle to the Project Graph View. When enabled, each project node gains a glowing halo ring; ring brightness scales with pending proposal count (read from each project's `.specclaw/STATUS.md` and `BACKLOG.md`). Clicking the halo opens a side drawer listing proposals with title, status badge, and link to the spec file. A `/api/backlog` endpoint scans all project working directories.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Halo renders as a neon ring; dim = 1 item, bright/pulsing = 5+
- AC2: Projects with no proposals show no halo
- AC3: Drawer lists each proposal: title, status badge, created date
- AC4: Overlay toggleable with keyboard shortcut `B` without leaving graph view
- AC5: Backlog endpoint scans all project dirs listed in `channels.json`
- AC6: Updates within 30s of a `.specclaw/STATUS.md` change

## P6 — Memory Constellation

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

The memory integration (PR #47) stores cross-channel memories in `memory.db` but the dashboard has no way to view, search, or manage memories. Operators cannot see what master Claude has learned or verify memory quality without running CLI commands.

### Proposed Solution

Add a `MemoryPanel` component and `/api/memories` endpoint to the mission control dashboard. The panel renders memories as a filterable grid grouped by type (decision / pattern / coordination / channel_summary / general). Each memory card shows: type badge, channel slug, content preview, access count, recency. Includes a search input, type filter, and per-card "Forget" button.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: All records from `memory.db` shown on load; refresh every 60s
- AC2: Filter by type and channel slug via dropdowns
- AC3: Search input filters by content substring
- AC4: Each card shows: id (truncated), type, slug, content (first 200 chars), access_count, last_accessed_at
- AC5: "Forget" button deletes record via DELETE `/api/memories/[id]`; card removed optimistically
- AC6: Empty state shown when no memories

---

## P7 — Schedule Timeline

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

The existing `SchedulerTable` shows schedules as a flat table with no temporal context. Operators cannot see when the next job will fire, which jobs are overdue, or how jobs cluster across the day.

### Proposed Solution

Replace or complement `SchedulerTable` with a horizontal swimlane timeline showing a 24h window. One row per project with scheduled jobs. Interval jobs show last-run marker and live countdown to next run. Daily HH:MM jobs show today's run slot. Paused schedules shown dimmed. Clicking a job block shows full config and a "Copy inject command" action.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: All entries from `schedules.json` rendered; 24h window centered on now
- AC2: Next-run countdown ticks live (no refresh)
- AC3: Paused schedules shown with strikethrough/dim styling
- AC4: Timeline scrollable horizontally; slug labels fixed on left
- AC5: "Copy inject command" available per job
- AC6: Jobs fired within last hour show "last ran X min ago" trailing marker

## P8 — WhatsApp Fleet Status

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

The dashboard has no visibility into WhatsApp adapter state. When `WHATSAPP_ENABLED` is set (PR #48), operators cannot see connection status, active WhatsApp-platform projects, or QR code events from the dashboard.

### Proposed Solution

Add a `WhatsAppStatus` badge to the Fleet Health Bar. When WhatsApp is enabled, show: connection status (connected / disconnected / pairing), active WhatsApp project count, and last message timestamp. The badge links to a filtered Instance Grid showing only `platform: whatsapp` projects. QR code events from `src/whatsapp-adapter.ts` surfaced as a banner in the Activity Feed.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: WhatsApp badge visible in header when `WHATSAPP_ENABLED=1` or `whatsapp-auth/` exists
- AC2: Badge shows: connected (green) / disconnected (red) / pairing (amber pulsing)
- AC3: Active WhatsApp project count shown; clicking filters Instance Grid
- AC4: QR code event rendered as a special banner in Event Feed with "scan within 60s" timer
- AC5: Badge hidden when WhatsApp not configured (no padding/space taken)

## P9 — Memory-Aware Heartbeat Prompt

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

The heartbeat schedule prompt does not currently instruct master Claude to use the memory tools before or after scanning. Channel summaries are not being persisted automatically, so the memory store remains empty even after memory integration shipped (PR #47).

### Proposed Solution

Update the recommended heartbeat schedule prompt template in `templates/master.CLAUDE.md` to include: (1) recall prior `channel_summary` memories before scanning; (2) save updated summaries after the scan; (3) save `coordination` memory after any inject. Update the example `schedule add` command in the template. Optionally add a default schedule to `bin/setup-new-instance.sh`.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: `templates/master.CLAUDE.md` heartbeat schedule example includes `mcp__mcd__recall` before scan and `mcp__mcd__remember` after
- AC2: Injected prompt from the example includes saving `coordination` memory post-inject
- AC3: `bin/setup-new-instance.sh` optionally bootstraps a heartbeat schedule with the updated prompt
- AC4: Existing scheduled jobs are not modified by this change (template only)

## P10 — Cross-Channel Timeline

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

Operators have no way to see how activity across all channels correlates over time. Events in the feed are ordered by arrival with no temporal axis, making it impossible to see whether a spike in one channel triggered stalls in others.

### Proposed Solution

Add a `/timeline` page with a horizontal multi-channel timeline. One swimlane per project. Events (spawns, replies, injects, stalls, specclaw completions) rendered as colored tick marks on a 24h or 6h scrollable axis. Axis is live — the right edge is "now" and scrolls automatically. Hovering a tick shows event details. Clicking jumps to that project's node in the Graph View.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: All projects shown as swimlanes; events from `/api/events` rendered as ticks within 2s of page load
- AC2: Time axis spans last 6h by default; 24h toggle available
- AC3: Right edge tracks "now" with a live cursor line; auto-scrolls
- AC4: Event types use the same color scheme as EventFeed
- AC5: Hovering a tick shows: type, timestamp, payload excerpt
- AC6: Empty swimlane (no events for project) shown as a dim line, not hidden

## P11 — Agent Diff Viewer

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

Operators cannot see what code changes a project agent has made between heartbeat cycles without SSHing into the server or opening the project channel. There is no quick way to review recent git diffs from the dashboard.

### Proposed Solution

Add a `/api/diff/[slug]` endpoint that runs `git diff HEAD~5..HEAD --stat` and `git log --oneline -10` on the project working directory. Add a "Diff" tab to the Project Graph detail drawer. Syntax-highlight the diff output (added/removed lines in green/red). Include commit log above the diff. Auto-refresh on drawer open.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Diff tab appears in graph node detail drawer
- AC2: Shows last 10 commits as a log above the diff
- AC3: Added lines highlighted green; removed lines highlighted red; context lines dim
- AC4: `/api/diff/[slug]` returns `{ log: string; diff: string; slug: string }`
- AC5: Empty diff ("nothing changed") shown with neutral message
- AC6: Diff truncated at 500 lines with a count of omitted lines

---

## P12 — Live Transcript Tail

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

Operators must open the tmux pane or the project's Discord channel to read what an agent is currently thinking or doing. The dashboard has no way to show a live or recent view of a project's transcript.

### Proposed Solution

Add a `/api/transcript/[slug]` endpoint that reads the latest `.jsonl` transcript file and returns the last N assistant/tool entries. Add a "Transcript" panel that can be pinned below the Instance Grid: shows last 20 assistant text blocks and tool calls in a neon-framed terminal-style box, auto-scrolling on new data. Polls every 5s when visible.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Transcript panel toggleable from the Instance Grid header
- AC2: Shows last 20 entries (assistant text + tool name + result snippet)
- AC3: Auto-scrolls to bottom on new entries; pauses if operator scrolls up
- AC4: Endpoint reads the most-recently-modified `.jsonl` in the project's transcript dir
- AC5: Tool calls shown with tool name badge (color-coded by category)
- AC6: Empty or missing transcript shown with "No transcript yet" placeholder

## P13 — Memory Graph

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

The Memory Panel shows memories as a flat list but gives no sense of how memories relate to each other or which channels contribute most. There is no way to see memory density or patterns at a glance.

### Proposed Solution

Add a `/memory-graph` page. Force-directed graph where each node is a memory (colored by type). Edges connect memories that share the same `channel_slug`. Node size scales with `access_count`. Cluster by type using D3 force grouping. Clicking a memory node shows full content. Includes a type filter strip identical to the Memory Panel. Graph re-renders on 60s poll.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: All memories from `memory.db` appear as nodes within 2s
- AC2: Node color matches memory type (reuse Memory Panel palette)
- AC3: Node size scales with access_count (min r=6, max r=20)
- AC4: Edges connect same-channel memories; edge opacity scales with shared access count
- AC5: Clicking a node opens a detail card with full content, type, slug, timestamps
- AC6: Type filter chips hide/show nodes without rebuilding simulation

## P14 — Command Palette

**Status:** `[x] done`
**Created:** 2026-06-20

### Problem

Navigating the dashboard requires clicking through multiple sections. Operators who know what they want (view a project, jump to a transcript, filter by state) must use the mouse. There is no keyboard-first navigation.

### Proposed Solution

Add a command palette (⌘K / Ctrl+K) that opens a searchable modal with instant results. Commands include: navigate to `/graph`, `/timeline`, `/memory-graph`; filter InstanceGrid by project slug; open a project's transcript panel; copy inject command for a slug. Results are fuzzy-matched against project slugs and command names. Recent commands shown when search is empty.

### Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Palette opens on Ctrl+K (or Cmd+K on Mac) from anywhere in the dashboard
- AC2: Typing filters commands and project slugs with fuzzy match; results update in <50ms
- AC3: Arrow keys navigate results; Enter executes; Escape closes
- AC4: Project-slug results show state badge (color) and age
- AC5: Recent commands (last 5) shown at top when input is empty
- AC6: Palette closes on backdrop click or Escape
